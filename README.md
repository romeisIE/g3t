Gitlab Time tracking tool

This tool is a unified way to track our project work time. There are multiple sources for time entries in our company.
Some of our colleagues track time in a excel sheet, some manually in the current time tracking application, or even in
the gitlab frontend in merge requests or issues. We want to unify all these time tracking sources together, make a nice
frontend for reporting and exporting to our current time tracking tool or every other external service.

Make time tracking fun again! :hourglass::smiley_cat:
